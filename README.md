# creative-ai
Creative AI is an intelligent tool that analyzes images, blends two pictures seamlessly into artistic transformations, and generates a smooth video of the conversion. It combines computer vision and deep learning to provide meaningful insights, creative editing, and visually stunning outputs for digital art, storytelling, and design.
Creative AI – Image Analysis, Blending & Video Generation
This project is a Creative AI system designed to go beyond basic image processing by combining artificial intelligence, image understanding, and creative transformations. It not only analyzes and provides detailed information about images but also merges two images together in a beautiful, seamless, and artistic way. On top of that, the system can generate a video showing the transformation from one image to the other, bringing static visuals to life.
✨ Key Features
🖼️ Image Understanding – Extracts and provides meaningful insights about uploaded images.
🎨 Smart Image Blending – Merges two images creatively with smooth transitions and artistic effects.
🎥 Video Generation – Creates a transformation video showing the conversion from one image to another.
🤖 AI-Powered Creativity – Uses deep learning and computer vision for unique, visually appealing results.
⚡ User-Friendly – Simple workflow: upload → analyze → blend → generate video.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV / Pillow for image processing
Deep Learning models for image analysis
MoviePy / FFmpeg for video creation
